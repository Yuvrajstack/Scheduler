# Streak Scheduler

Streak Scheduler is a discipline-based study management system that connects your syllabus, timetable, and daily consistency into one structured workflow.  
It is designed to help students build strong study habits by maintaining streaks and following a fixed routine.

This project focuses on productivity through discipline rather than simple task listing.
